# ConcurrentQueues

This library aims to provide a variety of different multi-producer multi-consumer queue implementations for usage in concurrent contexts. The queues provided are highly configurable for adapting to different usage contexts (single producer, single consumer, high write contention, high read contention). The aim is not to achieve complete lock freedom but to achieve the highest speed. When the correct queue is used and is configured to match the context of their usage, the queue can achieve linear speedup in the number of threads (up to the number of cores) both in enqueue in and dequeue operations by converging on a state of near zero contention.
